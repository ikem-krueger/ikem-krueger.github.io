I wanted to use Thunderbird in conjunction with my iCloud calender. I followed [this](https://frightanic.com/apple-mac/thunderbird-icloud-calendar-sync/) tutorial to make that work.

At one point in the tutorial, I needed to copy an url and extract some informations from it.

I wrote a web app to make that process easier. You can check them out [here](https://ikem-krueger.github.io/icloud-caldav-url/).
