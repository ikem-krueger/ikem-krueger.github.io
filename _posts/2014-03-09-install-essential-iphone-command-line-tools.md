First use Cydia to install “APT” and “MTerminal”.

Then open “MTerminal”:

For general shell tools (finger, fingerd, last, lsvfs, md, ps):

```
sudo apt-get install adv-cmds
```

For network tools (ftp, inetd, ping, rlogin, telnet, tftp):

```
sudo apt-get install network-cmds inetutils
```
