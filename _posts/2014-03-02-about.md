Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Marco alias "Ikem Krueger".

This blog is all about the things I do with my computer and overcoming troubles I have with them.

A long time I was into hardware, then operating systems and using software. Now Iâ€™m on my way to write software.

Thatâ€™s the stuff you will read about here.

If you like to, check out my work on the different networks in the header bar.

Have fun!
