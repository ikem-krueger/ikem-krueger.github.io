If it walks like a duck, and quackes like a duck, it's probably a penguin pretending to be a duck. :)

I'm a Linux user since the 90's. I'm now switching the side from the user to the developer.

I hope my blog is of value for you. I hope my tools are as well.

Have fun! And live long and prosper.

I have to thank Barry Clark for this blog engine. Check out his [repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) if you want one your own.
