Because I get often asked, what tools I recommend for Windows maintenance, I collected this list.

All tools are free and I use them regularly.

## Windows native

 - Disk Defragmenter (dfrgui.exe)
 - Disk Cleanup (cleanmgr.exe)

## Freeware

 - [Snappy Driver Installer Origin](https://www.glenn.delahoy.com/snappy-driver-installer-origin/) updates drivers.
 - [Device Cleanup Tool](https://www.uwe-sieber.de/misc_tools_e.html#DeviceCleanup) removes unused devices.
 - [AdwCleaner](https://toolslib.net/downloads/viewdownload/1-adwcleaner/) removes ad- and spyware.
 - [PatchMyPC](https://patchmypc.com/home-updater) updates installed programs.
