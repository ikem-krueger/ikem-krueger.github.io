title: Git for Windows and the secret GNU Toolchain
---

I wanted Git on my Windows system. I went to install [Git-Scm](https://git-scm.com/).

It seems that Git-Scm comes with a lot of the GNU tools:

So I put them to the system environment variable "PATH", and now I have access to them, with a minimum of overhead.
