title: Python IDE, Git, GNU Toolchain on Windows
---

I wanted Git and Python on my Windows system. I went to install Git-Scm and the Python IDE Thonny.

It seems that Git-Scm comes with a lot of the GNU tools. And Thonny with Python.

So if I put both to the system environment variable "PATH", I have access to all of them, with a minimum of overhead.
