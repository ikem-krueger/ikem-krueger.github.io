title: Python IDE, Git, GNU Toolchain on Windows
---

I wanted Git and Python on my Windows system. I went to install [Git-Scm](https://git-scm.com/) and the Python IDE [Thonny](http://thonny.org/).

It seems that Git-Scm comes with a lot of the GNU tools. And Thonny with Python.

So if I put both to the system environment variable "PATH", I have access to both of them, with a minimum of overhead.
