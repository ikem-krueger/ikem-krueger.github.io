title: Reasonable Colors palette for Gimp and Inkscape
tags: gimp, inkscape, firefox, javascript

I use [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) for vector graphics and recently I found [Reasonable Colors](https://reasonable.work/colors).

I know Inkscape supports custom color palettes, and I wanted the Reasonable Colors as an option.

So I wrote a little [script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ikem-krueger/ikem-krueger.github.io/master/_files/Reasonable%20Colors/scrape_reasonable_colors.js) for the Firefox console to scrape the colors from the website.

After some tweaking, I got the result I wanted.

Click on "[Reasonable Colors.gpl](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ikem-krueger/ikem-krueger.github.io/master/_files/Reasonable%20Colors/Reasonable%20Colors.gpl)" to download the color palette and then [import them into Inkscape](https://daviesmediadesign.com/how-to-import-palettes-into-inkscape/).
