title: Fedora boot fix DMA errors
---

I had to fix a box with Fedora with errors like:

```
[   11.631123] ata5.00: failed command: READ FPDMA QUEUED
[   11.631147] ata5.00: cmd 60/f0:68:18:09:80/00:00:04:00:00/40 tag 13 ncq 122880 in
[   11.631207] ata5.00: status: { DRDY }
```

I found out, that you can fix the error by disabling the feature "[Native Command Queuing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Command_Queuing)" or short "NCQ".

You do that by open "/etc/default/grub" and edit the line "GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT" and add "libata.force=noncq".

And then update the boot manager by:

```bash
mkconfig-grub -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
```
