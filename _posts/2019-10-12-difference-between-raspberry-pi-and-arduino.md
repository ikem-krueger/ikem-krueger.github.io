# Raspberry Pi

The Raspberry Pi runs a full blown operating system on it. Usually it is [Raspbian](https://www.raspbian.org) or a [Raspbian derivate](https://xbian.org). On Raspbian you run multiple programs at the same time (multi tasking). The Raspberry Pi has GPIO pins, but no analog input pins.

# Arduino

The Arduino runs one program (single tasking), and that's it. The Arduino has analog input/output pins.

# When do you use what?

That depends on the task(s). But basically, if it is a "single task job", you use an Arduino.
