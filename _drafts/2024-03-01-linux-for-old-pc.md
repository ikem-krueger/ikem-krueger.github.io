## Future improvements

 - Drop "cpufrequtils", because "powertop" should automatically set the cpu governor to "ondemand".
 - Make use of "acer_ec.pl" to set fan profile to "silent".
 - Some Firefox extensions are very useful: uBlock Origin, h264ify, I still don't care about cookies
 - Fix usb suspend for my Logitech mouse
