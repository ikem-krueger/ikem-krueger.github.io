For video conferences I bought the Logitech C270 HD webcam. The setup is really easy, plug-and-play. Plug the camera into a free USB 2.0 port, and Windows 10 recognize them immediatly. A short check with the Windows 10 "Camera" app showed, the picture quality is totally fine and the framerate is fast enough.

But one thing bothered me. The image is horizontally flipped. My first thought was, change that in the Windows settings. Well, there were no such settings. My second thought was, maybe Logitech has a tool to change that. Yes, they have a tool "Camere Settings", no, there is no setting to flip the image.
