I try to remove the whitelist from the UEFI for my HP Pavilion dm1 3101sg. I extracted the "sp54026.exe" with 7-Zip. I used Phoenixtool to decrypt "01611.bin". I opened  "01611.bin.DEC" with UEFITool and found the module which shows the string "104-Unsupported wireless network device" and extracted the "PE32 image section" body. I opened them with IDA Free.
