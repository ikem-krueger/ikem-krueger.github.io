Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This blog is all about the things I do with my computer and overcoming troubles I have with them.

A long time I was into hardware, then operating systems, using software.

Now I'm on my way to write software.

That's the stuff you will read about here.

If you like to, check out my work on the different networks in the header bar.

Have fun!
